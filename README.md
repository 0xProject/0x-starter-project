### Windows Development Setup

This starter project supports a Windows development environment. If you're setting up Node.js for the first time on Windows, you may find the following [StackOverflow guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15126050/running-python-on-windows-for-node-js-dependencies/39648550#39648550) useful. There are a few build tools required for Node.js on Windows which are not installed by default (such as Python). Please follow that guide before running through the tutorials.
